Vulnerability Summary: An encrypted CAPTCHA value is exposed in the response when invalid credentials are entered during login or password recovery, potentially allowing attackers to bypass CAPTCHA validation.

Impact: Attackers may reverse-engineer or tamper with the exposed CAPTCHA value, leading to automated brute-force attacks and compromising application security.

Remediation: Avoid exposing CAPTCHA values in error responses. Validate CAPTCHA server-side and use secure mechanisms to ensure the integrity of CAPTCHA tokens.
