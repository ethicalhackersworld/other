1.IDOR leads to account access

Vulnerability Name:
Session Hijacking through Token Manipulation / Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)

Vulnerability Description:
The application fails to securely handle sensitive parameters during the OTP verification phase, allowing an attacker to modify values, such as tokenid and user. By intercepting and altering these parameters in HTTP requests, an attacker can initiate OTP delivery to another user's registered mobile number. This allows unauthorized access to the OTP verification process as if the attacker were the victim, leading to unauthorized access to the victim's account.

Steps to Reproduce:
Log in to the application and proceed to the OTP delivery selection screen.
Choose "OTP to mobile" and intercept the request.
Modify the tokenid and user parameters to those of the victim.
Send the request; the OTP is sent to the victim’s mobile number.
Capture the OTP from the victim and complete the verification, gaining unauthorized access to the victim’s account.
Impact:
An attacker can bypass authentication and access other users' accounts by manipulating the OTP delivery method, leading to unauthorized access to sensitive user information and actions. This vulnerability exposes users to account takeover attacks, which can compromise personal data, account settings, and other sensitive details.

Remediation:
Implement Strong Session Management: Ensure that tokens and user identifiers are strongly tied to the authenticated user session and are not modifiable by clients.
Use Server-Side Validation: Validate tokenid and user parameters server-side to confirm they match the authenticated session.
Rate-Limiting and OTP Validation: Implement rate limiting on OTP requests and invalidate OTP tokens immediately after use to prevent reuse.
Enhance Logging and Monitoring: Log OTP delivery requests, and monitor for unusual activity patterns to detect potential exploitation attempts.

2. Commented Code

Vulnerability Name:
Information Disclosure via Commented Code in Source

Vulnerability Description:
The application contains commented code within the HTML source. This commented code may include sensitive information, such as API keys, file paths, internal system information, or debugging messages. Attackers can inspect these comments to gain insights into the application structure, discover hidden endpoints, or gather information that aids in further attacks.

Examples of Potential Information Disclosure:
API Keys or Secrets: If API keys or tokens are commented out in the HTML, attackers can extract them directly from the page source.
Endpoints or Internal URLs: Revealing internal API endpoints or endpoints under development can help attackers target specific functionalities.
Debugging Information: Comments indicating database queries, server paths, or environment settings provide attackers with clues on the server architecture and database setup.
Deprecated Code: Code that reveals older functionalities or endpoints that might still be accessible but not secure.
Steps to Reproduce:
Open the affected page in a browser.
Right-click on the page and select "View Page Source" or use browser developer tools.
Look for commented-out sections of HTML, JavaScript, or server-side code.
Inspect the comments to identify any sensitive information (e.g., tokens, environment details, endpoints).
Impact:
Information disclosure through comments can lead to:

Exposure of internal application structure.
Potential access to sensitive data like API keys or endpoints.
Increased risk of other attacks, including recon on infrastructure for further exploitation.
Remediation:
Remove Sensitive Information: Ensure that no sensitive data, such as keys, tokens, or internal comments, are present in the source code comments.
Regular Code Reviews: Conduct regular reviews of source code to prevent the inclusion of debugging or sensitive information in public code.
Minimize Comment Usage in Production: Only include essential comments in production environments and avoid commenting out functional or sensitive code.
Security Awareness: Train developers on the risks of leaving comments with sensitive information in client-accessible code.



3.Improper http headers

Vulnerability Name:
Missing Content Security Policy (CSP) and X-Frame-Options Headers

Vulnerability Description:
The application does not implement the Content Security Policy (CSP) and X-Frame-Options HTTP headers, which are critical for preventing certain types of attacks. The CSP header helps mitigate Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and other code injection attacks by specifying the allowed sources for content such as scripts, styles, and media. The X-Frame-Options header prevents Clickjacking by controlling whether a browser should allow a page to be displayed in an iframe.

Impact:
Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): Without CSP, there is no restriction on where scripts, styles, and other resources can be loaded from, making the application more vulnerable to XSS attacks. Attackers could potentially inject malicious scripts that steal user data or compromise the user’s session.
Clickjacking: Without X-Frame-Options, attackers can embed the application within iframes on malicious sites, tricking users into interacting with the application without realizing it (clickjacking). This could lead to unauthorized actions being performed or sensitive information being disclosed.
Remediation:
Implement Content Security Policy (CSP):

Add X-Frame-Options Header


4.Weak ciphers


Vulnerability Name:
Use of Weak Ciphers

Vulnerability Description:
The application allows the use of weak cryptographic ciphers for HTTPS connections, which compromises the security of data in transit. Weak ciphers, such as those with outdated encryption algorithms or small key sizes, are vulnerable to cryptographic attacks, allowing attackers to decrypt, intercept, or manipulate sensitive data being transmitted between clients and the server.

Impact:
Allowing weak ciphers undermines the confidentiality and integrity of sensitive information transmitted over HTTPS, exposing it to attacks such as:

Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Attacks: Attackers can intercept and decrypt traffic, potentially capturing sensitive information like login credentials and personal data.
Data Manipulation: Attackers may alter transmitted data, which could result in compromised data integrity and user trust.
Remediation:
Disable Weak Ciphers: Update server configurations to disallow weak ciphers, such as those using DES, RC4, or 3DES algorithms.
Enforce Strong Ciphers: Configure the server to use only strong, modern ciphers, such as AES with GCM mode and 256-bit keys.
Regularly Update Cipher Suites: Monitor and update supported cipher suites to follow industry standards and address emerging vulnerabilities.
Use TLS 1.2 or Higher: Configure the server to support only TLS 1.2 or higher, as older versions (such as SSL or TLS 1.0) are considered insecure.
