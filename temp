Got it. Hereâ€™s a short and clear description you can use for your report:

Issue:
The robots.txt file is publicly accessible. Although it currently does not expose any sensitive information, it is publicly viewable by design.

Impact:
Minimal impact. Public access to the robots.txt file is standard behavior and does not pose a direct security risk. However, if sensitive paths were to be added in the future, it could unintentionally disclose sensitive URLs to attackers.

Remediation:
No immediate action required. As a best practice, ensure that robots.txt does not list sensitive or private URLs. Sensitive areas should be protected with proper authentication and access controls, not hidden via robots.txt.
