Subject: Clarification on Cryptography Finding

Dear [Recipient],

During our recent security assessment, we identified weak cryptography in the application. We understand that this issue was reported earlier, and a fix was implemented but not deployed to production.

As per our process, until the fix is deployed to production, we consider the vulnerability as active in production. For this specific finding, we will not create a remediation plan (RP) post-deployment. Instead, we will verify the fix directly in production once it is deployed.

Please let us know if you have any questions or need further clarification.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
