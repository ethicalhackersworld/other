As a security analyst, you can highlight the issue like this:

"This finding relates to insufficient rate limiting on the OTP generation endpoint. Currently, the system allows multiple OTP requests to be made in a short period without restriction. This could lead to abuse, consuming server resources and incurring unnecessary costs for sending multiple OTP messages. The lack of rate limiting exposes the system to potential resource exhaustion attacks and financial impact. Implementing rate-limiting mechanisms would help mitigate these risks and improve overall system security."
