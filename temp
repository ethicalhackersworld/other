Correct! If OCSP Must-Staple is set to "No," it means that the server is not mandated to use OCSP stapling, and clients are not required to verify the certificate’s OCSP status through a stapled OCSP response during the TLS handshake.

Here’s what it means practically:

Implications of OCSP Must-Staple Being "No":

1. No Requirement for Stapled Responses:

The server can operate without sending a stapled OCSP response in the TLS handshake.

Clients (browsers, applications) will fall back to traditional OCSP checks by querying the OCSP responder URL themselves.



2. Clients Can Still Accept the Certificate:

If the OCSP responder is unavailable or the OCSP check fails, the client may still establish a connection unless strict certificate validation is enforced.



3. Potential Risks:

Without OCSP stapling, the client relies on direct OCSP checks, which:

Introduce latency (real-time query to the responder).

Could fail if the OCSP server is down, leading to potential soft-fail behavior where the client trusts the certificate anyway.

May expose client browsing habits to the OCSP responder, affecting privacy.




4. No Enforcement of Revocation Checking:

Clients are not strictly required to verify the certificate's revocation status. In some cases, this could allow the use of a revoked certificate if the client doesn’t perform proper OCSP checks.

How OCSP Must-Staple Affects Security

If Must-Staple = Yes:

The certificate explicitly requires the server to provide a valid stapled OCSP response.

If the server does not include the OCSP response, clients will reject the connection.

This ensures strong revocation checking and mitigates risks of using revoked certificates.


If Must-Staple = No:

The server and client can skip OCSP stapling, and revocation checking depends on the client’s fallback mechanisms (e.g., direct OCSP queries or CRLs).

This is less secure, especially if the OCSP responder is unavailable.

Should You Enable OCSP Must-Staple?

Enabling OCSP Must-Staple improves security but requires careful setup:

Ensure the server supports OCSP stapling and is properly configured.

Test the setup to avoid downtime or connectivity issues.

Request a certificate with the Must-Staple extension from your CA.
