Subject: Action Required – Update Integration to Use Dedicated Service Account in ServiceNow

Body:

Hello [Team/Name],

During our recent review of user account management in ServiceNow, we identified that integrations fetching or creating user accounts are currently running under a normal user account instead of the designated service account.

Using a normal user account for automated processes poses security and audit concerns, and may also lead to unintended user creation or modification.

Action Required:

Verify all integrations, imports, and scheduled jobs fetching/creating user records in ServiceNow.

Update credentials and “Run As” configurations to use the approved service account instead of any normal user account.

Restrict elevated roles (e.g., user_admin, security_admin) to the service account only.

Confirm access controls on sys_user and related tables are correctly enforced.


Goal:
Ensure all automated processes use the dedicated service account to maintain compliance, traceability, and least-privilege access.

Please let us know once this change is completed or if additional details are required from our side.

Thank you,
[Your Name]
[Your Position]

Would you like me to make it more strict/urgent (like an audit finding) or more collaborative/helpful (like a request for assistance)?
