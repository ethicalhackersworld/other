Vulnerability Name:Token Invalidation Failure or Improper Session ManagementVulnerability Issue:Tokens, such as JWTs or API tokens, are not being invalidated after a new token is generated. This allows old tokens to remain valid, posing a security risk.Description:When a user generates a new token (e.g., by logging in again or refreshing the token), the previous token should ideally be invalidated. If the application fails to revoke or invalidate the old token, both the old and new tokens will remain active. This creates a situation where an attacker who might have intercepted or stolen the old token could still use it to authenticate API requests, even though a new token has been issued.Impact:Session Hijacking: If an attacker gains access to the old token, they can use it to impersonate the user and access protected resources.Privilege Escalation: If token-based authentication is used for privilege management, an attacker could maintain unauthorized access for an extended period.Data Breach: Sensitive information may be exposed, and an attacker could misuse API endpoints while the old token is still valid.Remediation:Token Revocation: Implement proper token invalidation mechanisms to ensure that old tokens are revoked immediately when a new token is issued. This can be done through:Maintaining a server-side blacklist of invalidated tokens.Using short-lived tokens with refresh tokens.Expire Tokens: Ensure tokens have a short expiration time, so even if they are not revoked immediately, they expire quickly, reducing the window for misuse.Token Rotation: Apply token rotation strategies where old tokens are invalidated as soon as new tokens are generated.Audit Token Use: Track and log token usage to identify and prevent suspicious activity related to token re-use.Invalidate on Logout: Ensure that tokens are invalidated when the user logs out or initiates a password change.



 **Information Disclosure via Response Headers**.

### Vulnerability Name:
**Server and Framework Version Disclosure**

### Vulnerability Issue:
The response headers expose sensitive information, such as the web server's version (`Server` header) or the framework version (e.g., `X-AspNet-Version`), which can be used by attackers to identify potential vulnerabilities associated with specific software versions.

### Description:
When a web server includes headers like `Server` or `X-AspNet-Version` in HTTP responses, it discloses the specific version of the server software (e.g., Apache, Nginx) or the underlying framework (e.g., ASP.NET). Attackers can use this information to look up known vulnerabilities in the disclosed versions, making it easier for them to target the application with exploits.

For example:
- `Server: Apache/2.4.49`
- `X-AspNet-Version: 4.0.30319`

Disclosing such information unnecessarily increases the attack surface, as specific versions might have known security flaws that an attacker can exploit.

### Impact:
- **Reconnaissance**: Attackers can gather details about the server and framework versions, helping them target specific vulnerabilities or exploits associated with those versions.
- **Exploitation of Known Vulnerabilities**: If an attacker identifies that the server is running an outdated or vulnerable version, they may use known exploits to compromise the server or application.
- **Increased Attack Surface**: More information about the system increases the likelihood of a successful attack.

### Remediation:
1. **Disable Server Version Disclosure**:
   - For Apache: Set `ServerTokens Prod` and `ServerSignature Off` in the configuration to prevent the server from exposing its version.
   - For Nginx: Use `server_tokens off;` to disable server version disclosure.
2. **Remove Framework Version Headers**:
   - For ASP.NET: In `web.config`, add `<httpRuntime enableVersionHeader="false" />` to remove the `X-AspNet-Version` header.
3. **Custom Headers**: Configure the web server to send generic or no `Server` headers (e.g., `Server: Web Server` or no header at all).
4. **Security through Obscurity**: While this isn't a primary security measure, hiding version information makes it more difficult for attackers to target known vulnerabilities.
5. **Regular Patching and Updates**: Ensure that the web server and frameworks are regularly updated to the latest secure versions, even if the version information is hidden.

By removing or masking version disclosure, you reduce the likelihood that attackers can exploit known vulnerabilities based on the disclosed software versions.

 **Improper Rate Limiting Error Handling**.

### Vulnerability Name:
**Improper Rate Limiting Error Handling**

### Vulnerability Issue:
When the API is hit excessively in a short period (e.g., 100 times at once), the server processes the requests but returns an uninformative or technical error message like "youcancallthisevery2seconds," rather than a user-friendly or generic error. This can expose internal logic or rules, providing attackers with unnecessary insights.

### Description:
When APIs enforce rate limiting (i.e., restricting how many times an API can be called within a given time frame), they often return an error when the limit is exceeded. In this case, instead of returning a generic message or a custom error response, the API exposes a system-level error such as "youcancallthisevery2seconds." This provides an attacker with information about how the rate limiting is implemented (e.g., a 2-second window) and could be used to fine-tune their attack by making requests just below the rate limit threshold.

Exposing such internal details unnecessarily helps attackers understand your rate-limiting strategy and adjust their request patterns to bypass the protection or engage in abuse more effectively.

### Impact:
- **Rate Limit Bypass**: Attackers could use the specific error message to adjust their requests and avoid hitting the rate limit by sending requests just under the threshold.
- **Denial of Service (DoS)**: Attackers might overwhelm the system by exploiting knowledge about the rate-limiting policy.
- **Information Leakage**: Exposing error messages that reveal internal logic could assist attackers in planning their next steps, like identifying ways to bypass or exploit the system.

### Remediation:
1. **Custom Error Responses**: When rate limits are exceeded, return a generic, user-friendly error message. For example:
   - HTTP Status Code: `429 Too Many Requests`
   - Custom message: `"You have exceeded the request limit. Please try again later."`
   Avoid exposing details such as how frequently the API can be called.
2. **Custom Error Handling**: Ensure that all error handling mechanisms, including rate limiting, return standard or generic responses rather than exposing implementation details.
3. **Error Logs**: Keep detailed error information available in logs for internal use, but don't display it in the API response.
4. **Rate Limiting Throttling Mechanism**: Ensure your rate-limiting mechanism is appropriately tuned to prevent excessive requests, and that it doesn't
