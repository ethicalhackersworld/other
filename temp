No, this is not a proper implementation of OAuth 2.0. Let me explain why:

### **Issues with the Current Implementation:**

1. **Hardcoding Client ID and Secret:**
   - OAuth 2.0 requires that the **client ID** and **client secret** are securely stored and **not hardcoded** in the client-side code. Hardcoding them exposes these credentials, which an attacker could extract from the application, potentially allowing unauthorized access to the APIs.
   
2. **No Authorization Redirection:**
   - In a proper OAuth 2.0 flow, especially for flows like **Authorization Code Grant**, the user should be redirected to an authorization server (e.g., Google, GitHub, etc.) to authenticate and grant the application access to resources. The current implementation bypasses this entirely, suggesting that no user consent is required, which violates the OAuth 2.0 principles of user authorization and consent.

3. **Passing Client ID and Secret in the Authorization Header:**
   - The practice of passing **client ID and secret** (even in Base64-encoded format) in an Authorization header is not secure. In OAuth 2.0, **tokens** (like access tokens or refresh tokens) should be passed in the Authorization header, not the client credentials.

4. **Missing Token-based Authorization:**
   - OAuth 2.0 uses tokens (access tokens and refresh tokens) for API authorization after a proper authentication process. These tokens are obtained through proper OAuth 2.0 flows (like Authorization Code Grant, Implicit Flow, Client Credentials, etc.), not through hardcoded credentials.

### **Proper OAuth 2.0 Implementation Should Include:**

1. **Proper OAuth Flow (Authorization Code Grant or Implicit Flow):**
   - The client should redirect the user to the OAuth 2.0 authorization server for authorization.
   - After the user consents, the client should exchange an authorization code for an access token (in **Authorization Code Grant**) or receive an access token directly (**Implicit Flow**).
   - The **Client Credentials Grant** (which is sometimes used for machine-to-machine communication) could be relevant here, but even in that case, the client ID and secret should not be hardcoded in client-side code and must not be directly exposed.

2. **Use of Access Tokens:**
   - The Authorization header should contain the **Bearer token** (access token), not the client ID and secret. The server should validate this token to ensure the request is authorized.

3. **Secure Storage of Credentials:**
   - The client ID and secret should be securely stored (e.g., on the server-side, or in a secure storage mechanism if they are needed for server-to-server communication).

4. **Token Exchange:**
   - After authorization, the client exchanges a **code** or **credentials** for an access token at the OAuth token endpoint, and that token should be used for API calls.

5. **Token Expiration and Refresh:**
   - The access token should have an expiration, and the client should use a **refresh token** to obtain a new access token when needed.

### **Impact of Current Implementation:**

1. **Security Risks:**
   - Hardcoding the client ID and secret exposes sensitive credentials to attackers. If these credentials are compromised, attackers can impersonate the client and access protected resources.

2. **Non-compliance with OAuth 2.0 Standard:**
   - The current implementation is not compliant with OAuth 2.0 standards. It lacks user authorization steps, token-based authorization, and secure handling of credentials.

3. **Vulnerable to Attacks:**
   - Passing credentials in the Authorization header without tokens makes the system vulnerable to **man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks** and **credential theft**, especially if the application does not use HTTPS.

---

### **Recommendations:**

1. **Follow OAuth 2.0 Authorization Flows:**
   - Implement proper OAuth flows based on the use case (Authorization Code Grant, Implicit Flow, or Client Credentials).

2. **Store Client Secrets Securely:**
   - Ensure the client secret is securely stored on the server side, and only the access token (issued after a valid OAuth flow) is passed to the API.

3. **Use Tokens in Authorization Headers:**
   - The `Authorization` header should contain `Bearer <access_token>` rather than client ID and secret.

4. **Apply HTTPS:**
   - Ensure all communication occurs over HTTPS to prevent eavesdropping and ensure that authorization tokens are securely transmitted.

By addressing these issues, the implementation will align with OAuth 2.0 standards and improve both security and compliance.
