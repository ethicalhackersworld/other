Subject: Yearly Review – Security Engineering Activities & Future Plans

Dear [Manager's Name],

I hope this email finds you well. As we approach the end of the year, I would like to take the opportunity to provide a review of my current tasks, responsibilities, and future objectives, in alignment with both my personal career development and the goals of the team.

Current Activities and Key Responsibilities:

Over the past year, my role as a Senior Security Engineer has primarily involved working on security assessment tickets, where I continue to ensure that we deliver top-tier security evaluations for our clients. My day-to-day activities revolve around the following core responsibilities:

1. Security Assessment and Pentesting:
I am actively involved in both internal and client-facing penetration testing assignments. This includes conducting assessments, reporting findings, and working closely with the client to explain and resolve vulnerabilities. I manage all aspects of these engagements, from initial scoping to final report delivery. Additionally, I ensure that all vulnerabilities are tracked and addressed in a timely manner via our findings tracker.


2. Client Interaction:
I frequently collaborate directly with clients, ensuring their needs are met and helping them to understand the security implications of our findings. This communication is key, as I ensure transparency and prioritize follow-up actions to mitigate risks identified during assessments.


3. Report Generation and Presentations:
I lead the process of generating detailed reports that summarize our findings, recommended mitigations, and overall security posture. I also present these findings to the clients, customizing reports and presentations based on specific requirements to ensure they are actionable and easily understandable.


4. Continuous Improvement:
On a regular basis, I review our internal processes, including updating our pentesting frameworks, improving findings tracking, and optimizing the way we collaborate with clients to ensure we maintain the highest standards in security assessments.



Upcoming Plans and Certifications:

Looking ahead, I am aiming to further enhance my technical skill set and certifications to keep pace with evolving industry demands. My primary goal for the next year is to pursue the Offensive Security Certified Professional (OSCP) certification. This will not only strengthen my penetration testing skills but also deepen my understanding of advanced attack methodologies and techniques.

In addition to the OSCP, I plan to continue expanding my knowledge in various security domains, with a focus on cloud security, application security, and emerging threats. These areas align with the evolving needs of our clients and the direction of our security engineering team.

Conclusion:

It has been a rewarding year in which I have contributed to key client projects and successfully navigated the complexities of high-stakes security assessments. I remain committed to strengthening my technical expertise and enhancing our team’s ability to provide exceptional service to our clients.

Please let me know if there are any additional areas you would like me to focus on or if you require any further details for this review. I look forward to discussing my growth and contributions over the past year and aligning on our goals for the future.

Thank you for your continued support and guidance.

Best regards,
[Your Full Name]
Senior Security Engineer
