Security Issue: Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)
Description:
The issue involves a URL parameter loginname containing an encrypted value representing user identifiers. An attacker can manipulate this encrypted parameter to gain unauthorized access to a victim's account. This suggests that the encryption or the logic used to generate and validate this parameter is flawed, allowing attackers to potentially predict or modify the encrypted values to access other users' accounts.

Impact:

Unauthorized Access: Attackers can access accounts belonging to other users, potentially leading to exposure of sensitive personal information.
Data Breach: There is a risk of confidential data being accessed or leaked, depending on the applicationâ€™s nature and data security policies.
Account Takeover: Attackers can perform actions on behalf of the victim, such as sending messages or altering account settings, leading to further misuse of the application.
Recommendation:

Strengthen Encryption: Ensure that the encryption used to generate user identifiers is robust and not easily reversible. Consider using strong, modern encryption algorithms and practices.
Implement Access Controls: Validate that the authenticated user has the necessary permissions to access the specific resource or account. Instead of relying on encrypted parameters alone, use server-side validation and access control checks.
Use UUIDs: Consider using UUIDs (Universally Unique Identifiers) for user IDs or sessions instead of encrypting or encoding user-specific data in the URL parameters.
Implement Parameter Validation: Ensure that any parameter passed in URLs is properly validated and that invalid or tampered parameters are rejected. Implement additional layers of validation beyond just the encrypted value.
Audit and Test: Regularly audit and test the application for similar vulnerabilities, employing techniques like penetration testing to identify potential weaknesses.
By addressing these recommendations, you can mitigate the risk of unauthorized account access and enhance the overall security of your application.
