Citrix Breakout Verification – Detailed Explanation

1. Objective
To assess whether the Citrix Workspace environment enforces proper application control policies to prevent users from executing unauthorized programs (including Windows command shells) within the virtual session.


---

2. Background
In a secure Citrix deployment, application whitelisting is commonly implemented using Windows AppLocker, Citrix policies, or third-party endpoint control solutions.
These controls typically allow only a predefined set of executables to run and block others — especially potentially dangerous utilities such as cmd.exe or powershell.exe.

However, weak enforcement mechanisms may rely solely on filename/path checks instead of validating the file's digital signature, hash, or internal metadata.
This creates a security gap: if a restricted executable is renamed to a non-blocked filename, the system may mistakenly allow it to run.

3. Steps Performed

Step	Action	Purpose

1	Identified that cmd.exe was blocked when executed directly from the Citrix session.	To confirm enforcement of application restriction policy.
2	Copied cmd.exe from its original path (C:\Windows\System32\cmd.exe) to a temporary directory accessible in the Citrix environment.	To attempt circumvention of the policy.
3	Renamed the copy to aaaa.exe.	To bypass filename/path-based execution restrictions.
4	Executed aaaa.exe within the Citrix session.	To verify if the renamed executable would run.
5	Successfully obtained an interactive Windows Command Prompt.	Confirmed breakout capability.

4. Observations

The Citrix Workspace environment allowed execution of the renamed cmd.exe.

This indicates the restriction policy does not validate the executable by hash, signature, or internal attributes — it is purely based on the original filename or a hardcoded list.

Once command prompt access is obtained, further escalation is possible (access to sensitive files, registry, mapped drives, or network pivoting).

5. Risk Rating: High

This vulnerability allows policy bypass and potentially enables malicious actors to perform privilege escalation, data exfiltration, or lateral movement.

In regulated industries, this could lead to non-compliance with security standards such as ISO 27001, PCI DSS, or HIPAA.



---

6. Recommendation

Implement hash/signature-based application allowlists (AppLocker, WDAC) instead of relying on filename checks.

Restrict file write/rename permissions in directories accessible to users.

Monitor for process creation events of restricted binaries regardless of filename (e.g., via Sysmon event 1).

Test Citrix breakouts periodically during internal security reviews.



---

7. Conclusion
The activity was part of an authorized internal penetration test to validate Citrix Workspace security posture.
The result confirmed that application control policies could be bypassed by renaming restricted executables, representing a legitimate operational security concern.

If you want, I can also prepare a short 3–4 line executive summary for your Threat Intel team so it’s concise in your incident tracking system. That way it won’t look like a threat alert but a documented test.
